               Is there a best place to live? 
            </p>

                With technology, human beings can live anywhere, even outer space and eventually Mars. Is there a best place to live? 
                By the quirk of our biology, we like to associate with other monkeys. This is why places with a lower population like 
                Wichita are unappealing.

                Naval Ravikant says that where you live is the single most important decision you make. I did a thought experiment to try to understand
                why. My parents came from very small towns in India. SHould they have come to the United States? Part of me agrees - it would feel good to build
                up India into first world status. How do I reconcile this?

                Now, there has been a heated debate on the H1B visa. And many people mention, man why don't Indians just build India. And I agree with them.

                But it is what it is. I am here now and I spent my whole life in the Greater Boston area, even attending college here and serving as an EMT here.
                I am not going to desert. I am going to build up the Greater Boston area, tough trhough the bad times, and help improve my community.
