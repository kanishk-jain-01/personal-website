                    Freedom is amazing, but two of the biggest detractors of it today are school and employment. 
                    I think both those things are not completely without merit. 
                    Working in a mission driven environment like xAI or SpaceX would be a great opportunity to build your skills and embark on a fulfilling mission with a team.
                    It can also allow you to save money and provide you with handsome stock options. 
                    School - especially college - gives you the opportunity to study what you want, live on your own, and meet cool people.  
                    Regardless, having the option to walk away and build your own income generating project is just nice.

                    When we were hunter gatherers we were more free than we are today. 
                    An individual had the knowledge needed to survive alone in the wild. 
                    We knew which plants to eat and how to hunt. 
                    A stable food supply was not guaranteed, but at least we had confidence in our skills and a sense of self-sufficiency.
                    Despire the perils of that lifestyle, this competency made us happier. 
                    Unfortunately, it is neither feasible nor desirable to go back to those times - we must look forward. 
                    For those of us that are unfulfilled and dread going to work, how can we be happy like our ancestors?
                    I think the answer is learning how to contribute to the free-market on your own terms - this is the modern day equivalent to 'hunting'
                    Once we develop this skill, then you can always walk away from any situation and just make it on our own. 
                    Unfortunately, they don't teach us this in school.
                    Whether it was homeworks, projects, or examiniations - we only did things that a higher up told us to do. 
                    This only teaches you how to be a worker, not a hunter. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how do we hunt in the modern day? 
                    I think Naval Ravikant is right here when he says you should learn to do two things: build & sell. 
                    I am going to stop here with the advice before I make a fool of myself, as I have not achieved this self-sufficiency yet. 
                    All I can say is that, I love engineering, medicine, energy, mathematics, physics. 
                    I will look to build my skills in these areas. Currently I am starting small with a organic cotton business (allcottonbrand.com) and working at xAI. 
                    I love the process of writing and posting on social media. That can be my form of selling.
                    I could see myself creating eduational STEM content because I love to explain complex topics in an easy to understand way. 
                    I am finding that my own curiositiy is guiding me and I hope that with enough time, I can also eventually become self sufficient. 
                </p>

                    Lastly, why do we have to contribute to the free market at all? It is because that is the best way we found to organize society in a place with limited resources. 
                    Eventually, I do envision a post-capitalistic world or at least a world with more abundance:
                    Imagine if your town was a city-state that had it's own nuclear reactor, army of worker robots, automated transportation systems, and automated farms. 
                    Imagine if you didn't have to go to work and you could use your free-time to do things you wanted to do, instead of waste time listening to obsolete paths society tells you to traverse. 
                    Imagine if we all had the knowledge of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and we were Modern Day Jedi. I personally want to get there. I want to help others get there. 
                    Even if you just succeeded on one aspect of it, such as creating robots that do all of your housework for you, that would be great thing because other people will 
                    be working on other aspects. Collectively, we will live in massive abundance. 
                    Not only does this future sound more free, it also sounds more fun. Let's accelerate.
